FS14_hallway_talk
=================


In learning to program I frequently hear engineers who have been working for ten or more years utter the words, "Man! You guys have it so easy these days! Do you have any idea how long that would have taken ten years ago?" Finally I came to a point where I thought in response, "No, I have no clue, but it would be cool to find out."

This talk is part of a larger exploration in building things from scratch. And it stems from my firm belief that there is tremendous educational value in taking things apart for the sake of putting them back together--fixing things that aren't broken, if you will. 

The decision to build a performance monitor that tracks runtime came from the fact that I was presenting at New Relic's Future Stack. This program measures runtime of a function as well as it's sub functions. Enjoy the code and for something far less impressive, have a look at my [talk](http://youtu.be/KN_BKJdv1-o)
